## Gemfile splits

During the docker build, we run an independent script (`init.rb`), which doesn't require most dependencies, only
redis. This is part of a multi-stage-docker-build (See `Dockerfile`). The dependency for this special bundle
are maintained in `Gemfile.build / Gemfile.build.lock`.

- `Gemfile`: Actual application Gemfile, used by the web app
- `Gemfile.build`: CI Gemfile, only used during build
